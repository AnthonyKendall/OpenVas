# OpenVas

## Objective

OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is an open-source vulnerability scanning and management tool used to assess the security of networks, systems, and applications. Its primary objective is to identify security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. OpenVAS performs thorough vulnerability assessments by scanning devices and services to detect vulnerabilities, providing detailed reports to help security professionals take appropriate actions to mitigate risks. It is widely used for penetration testing, network security monitoring, and compliance auditing.

### Skills Learned

- Installation and Configuration: Understanding how to install OpenVAS on various operating systems (e.g., Linux, Windows) and configure it to scan networks and systems effectively.
- Vulnerability Scanning: Learning how to create and customize scan configurations, including selecting scan targets, defining scan policies, and scheduling scans.
- Managing Vulnerability Data: Analyzing scan results, interpreting vulnerability reports, and prioritizing remediation based on risk levels and potential impact.
- Creating and Customizing Scan Policies: Developing custom scan policies and profiles tailored to specific network environments or compliance requirements for more accurate assessments.
- Regular Updates and Maintenance: Keeping the OpenVAS installation up-to-date by updating its vulnerability database (NVTs) and ensuring the scanner is properly maintained for optimal performance.
